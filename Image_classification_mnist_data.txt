image -> array -> neural network ->  classify

read image -> opencv
array -> numpy
neural network & classify -> tensorflow, keras

Image classification:

dataset
visulize
preprocess -> noise removal,resizing,rescaling
normalize -> 0 to 1
train & test
model create -> CNN
train & classify
evaluate metrices -> confusion matrix


### categorical

[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
0 - [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
1 - [0,1,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0]
2 - [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
